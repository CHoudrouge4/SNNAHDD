Scalable Nearest Neighbor Algorithms for High Dimensional Data

The main goal of this project is to implement several Data Structures(Trees) that are efficient for Nearest Neighbour Search in higher dimensional data. 
A detailed description of these Data Structures is presented in [This paper](https://github.com/CHoudrouge4/SNNAHDD/blob/master/06809191.pdf).

## Step Zero
This step is implementing **The k-d Tree**.

### Current Status:
	* Constructing The Tree: **done**
	* Querying  The tree: **done**
	* Allowing The user to specify the distance function.

## Step One
This step is implementing **The Randomized k-d Tree**


## Step Two
This Step is implementing **The Priority Search K-Means Tree**
