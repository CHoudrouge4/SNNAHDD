Scalable Nearest Neighbor Algorithms for High Dimensional Data

The main goal of this project is to implement several Data Structures(Trees) that are efficient for Nearest Neighbour Search in higher dimensional data.
A detailed description of these Data Structures is presented in [This paper](https://github.com/CHoudrouge4/SNNAHDD/blob/master/06809191.pdf).

The result of this project is documented in the following [document.](https://choudrouge4.github.io/pdfs/snnahdd.pdf).
